Description: 
            This is a repositry for our term project for machine learning ,in which we have to train our model and test its 
            accuracy .
            
            
            
Problem Statment:
            Given problem was that employees are leaving early ,we were given data set of 15000 employees including those who are leaving 
            and whose are not.






Model:      






            Model we are using here to solve our problem is Logistic regression for binary classification.
Test and training:




            We have taken 70% data for training and around 30 % for testing our accuracy.
            
 
 Accuracy:
            After all the step when we trained our model our accuracy is 78.086%

 Accuracy:
            After all the step when we trained our model our accuracy is 95.444%%
